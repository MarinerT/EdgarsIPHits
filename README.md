# Edgar's IP Hits: Has the global financial research market become more global?

## Introduction
This EDA looks at the log files of the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR site from February 2003 and June 2017 to graph any changes in country distributions through geolocating IP addresses.

## Background
EDGAR is the SEC's database that houses the periodic financial statements, registrations, and other public declarations as required by law of publicly traded companies on US exchanges.  The US market represents approximately 53% of the global financial trade, making EDGAR a highly valuable resource for investors internationally. [statista.com] 

## Hypothesis
Globally, internet usage increased from 413 million people in 2000 to over 3.4 billion people in 2016 with the US representing approximately 50% in 2000 and 8% in 2016. [ourworldindata.org, statista.com] As such, we would expect the proportion of IP addresses designated for the US to decrease even slightly despite our global financial hegemony. 

Null Hypothesis: There has been no change or an increase in the proportion of hits on EDGAR.
Alternative Hypothesis: There has been a decrease in the proportion of hits on EDGAR.
